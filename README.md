## ðŸ¤– AI Usage Report

The development of this project was significantly accelerated and enhanced using a variety of AI tools:

- âœ¨ **ChatGPT** (OpenAI): 
  - Assisted in ideating the layout and structure of the landing page.
  - Generated clean, modular React (Next.js) components using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
  - Helped troubleshoot issues related to deployment, Git conflicts, and responsive design.
  - Provided suggestions for implementing dark/light themes and accessibility enhancements.

- ðŸ¤– **GitHub Copilot**:
  - Provided real-time code suggestions while writing components and styling elements.
  - Auto-completed repetitive patterns like map functions, classNames, and JSX structures.
  - Suggested optimizations for component reuse and readability.

- ðŸŽ¨ **AI Image Tools** (e.g. [Unsplash AI Search](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/ai), [RunwayML], etc.):
  - Helped source and select images relevant to blog posts and hero banners.
  - Enhanced the visual appeal of the site with high-quality AI-assisted visuals.

These tools collectively saved hours of development time, improved code quality, and allowed for rapid iteration on both functionality and design. AI acted as a real-time assistant, mentor, and designer throughout the development process.
